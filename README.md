# Node.js-MySQL

I've created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

# Inquirer prompt Questions:
- ask for product ID
- ask for Quantity of product

# I use these npms.

* inquirer
* mysql

# How To Use bamazon
1. First step is to download inquirer and mysql in your command prompt or git bash.
![]()
2. Second step is to open the command prompt at the Node.js-MySQL folder.
![]()
3. Next type in:
```node bamazonCustomer.js``` (or whatever you named your JavaScript file).
![]()
4. Then it will show you the products that are in the database.
![]()
5. After that it will as you for the ID of the product you want (type in the ID number).
![]()
6. It will then ask you for the Quantity of the amount of the product you want (type in the Quantity amount).
![]()
7.
